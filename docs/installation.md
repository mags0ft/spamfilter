# Installation

In this document, you will learn how to install the `spamfilter` module. There are generally three options to
get started.

## ðŸ‘‰ How to install

You may install the module using `pip`, which is the easiest way to do it as `spamfilter` is in the PyPI index.

To achieve this, run

`pip install spamfilter`

in your terminal. If that doesn't work, for example due to `pip` not being added to your PATH, just try

`python3 -m pip install spamfilter`

instead.

You can also install `spamfilter` without using the Python package index and instead install the source files locally. This can be achieved using this website's [download links](https://github.com/mags0ft/spamfilter/zipball/master) at the very top or the files available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mags0ft/spamfilter).

Place the `.zip` or `.tar.gz`-files into your project folder, unpack them and move the `src` folder into your project root.

**ðŸš© Note that the manual install using download is not recommended because it's way less optimized, bloated with unnecessary files and hard to do.**
