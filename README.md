The `spamfilter` module is a lightweight, fast and straightforward Python package that helps you to build your own [spam filtering pipelines](https://mags0ft.github.io/spamfilter/pipelines/) in order to keep your applications featuring user-generated content clean.

It's object-oriented and makes a quick, concise approach to remove spam easy. `spamfilter` is highly configurable and ships with deep integrations for [third-party APIs](https://mags0ft.github.io/spamfilter/filters/#spamfilter.filters.API) and language models via [Ollama](https://mags0ft.github.io/spamfilter/filters/#spamfilter.filters.Ollama).

## Installation

You can [install spamfilter](https://mags0ft.github.io/spamfilter/installation/) by cloning the GitHub repository, downloading it from the GitHub page or using pip - which is the recommended approach:

```bash
pip install spamfilter
```

Please see the [installation guide](https://mags0ft.github.io/spamfilter/installation/) for more information on how to install `spamfilter` and its dependencies, especially if you plan to use API or Ollama functionality.

## Usage

Define a [pipeline](https://mags0ft.github.io/spamfilter/pipelines/) using several spam [filters](https://mags0ft.github.io/spamfilter/filters/) stacked onto each other.

```python
from spamfilter.filters import Length, SpecialChars
from spamfilter.pipelines import Pipeline

# create a new pipeline
m = Pipeline([
    # length of 10 to 200 chars, crop if needed
    Length(min_length=10, max_length=200, mode="crop"),
    # limit use of special characters
    SpecialChars(mode="normal")
])

# test a string against it
TEST_STRING = "This is a test string."
print(m.check(TEST_STRING).passed)
```

Output:

```
True
```
